# PyObf
Software obfuscation library intended for rapid constructions of obfuscators.

With PyObf one can:

Supported obfuscators:
* JavaScript: [Yahoo!'s YUICompressor](http://yui.github.io/yuicompressor/), [Google's Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/), and [jsPacker](http://dean.edwards.name/download/#packer) (perl version)
